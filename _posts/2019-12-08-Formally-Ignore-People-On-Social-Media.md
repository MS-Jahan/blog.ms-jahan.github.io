I know this may sound cruel or unsocialistic but sometimes you may need to ignore people online without breaking friendship and social bond. The reason behind this may be your busyness or sometimes you may want someone not to think that you care about him/her etc. ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚

Now, to ignore someone without directly mentally hurting him/her, follow this steps in your style wisely:
1. Don't message the person saying something like "Hi". Don't message him/her unless you have no options left.
2. Reply to messages using few words or in short sentences.
3. Don't use emojis, unusual capitalization or regional language.
4. Delay in replying to messages.
5. If none of those works, try not sending messages temporarily (i.e. for 2-3 minutes; may differ according to situation) after making messages being seen.

The words stated above are just some random thoughts from the owner of this blog. Those aren't universal truth or law and not written to hurt anyone.
